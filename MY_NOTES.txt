- reducers: are handlers
    -> reducres must be pure functions (an input should always generate the same output, always)
    -> it deals with a slice of the state
    -> the functions that takes the prev state, an action, and returns a new state


- actions: are functions that use .dispatch in them ???
    -> {type: ADD_TODO, payload: 'wash dishes'}

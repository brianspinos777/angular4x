- reducers: are handlers
    -> reducres must be pure functions (an input should always generate the same output, always)
    -> it deals with a slice of the state
    -> the functions that takes the prev state, an action, and returns a new state


- actions: are functions that use .dispatch in them ???
    -> {type: ADD_TODO, payload: 'wash dishes'}

- container components: smart components that know about redux
- dumb components: 
    -> are presentational components, they are concern with how things look.
    -> they should be highly configurable/reusable
    -> they do NOT dispatch actions


async actions (http requests):
    ->
